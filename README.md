# Potatoeyo-s-Calculator-2023-v0.2
My own custom calculator. Its currently Work In Progress and its made in TurboWarp (better Scratch editor)
No tedious extra extracting required (unlike my fan-made WHG game which requires four extra extractions after extracting the full ZIP)

v0.0 - Created October 12, 2023 (19 days before release to GitHub)

v0.1 - Release to GitHub
Added two CONVERSION buttons "Fraction to Percent" and "Percent of Number"
Added "help" button (shows all functions for each other button)

v0.2 - New Changes
Added Z-Score Button
Fixed "help" button layering (now it appears as front layer every time the help button is clicked)
